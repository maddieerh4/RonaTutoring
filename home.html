        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Rona Tutoring was founded in March by three high schoolers trying<br> 
          to make a difference. Our mission is to bridge the learning gap caused<br>
          by community disruptions by providing tutors to those whose learning<br>
          has been affected. We cover any subject from Pre-K to 12th grade but we <br>
          primarily tutor in STEM subjects and English. All for free! We look <br> 
          forward to hearing from you!</p>

        <h1>Our Hope</h1>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has altered education worldwide, and in <br>
          most cases, resulted in the loss of learning opportunities and <br>
          less engaged learning. We hope by providing these free resources, <br>
          students can stay on top of their school material and stay motivated <br>
          to learn, even when they're stuck at home.</p>
